=============

Cpp source code formatter for Google C++ StyleThis is a fork of astyle (http://astyle.sourceforge.net/astyle.html).

Astyle is a free, fast and small automatic formatter for C, C++, C+, and Java
source code.

This fork, however, only aims at formatting C++ code according to Google C++
Style Guide (http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml)

Astyle-google code base is astyle-google clean, meaning you should always
run astyle-google on top of astyle-google source code before committing.

The command line flags we are using are:

--style=linux --indent=spaces=2
